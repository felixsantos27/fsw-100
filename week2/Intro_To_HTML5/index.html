            <p>Above are some hi resolution images I found of cars. I've been into cars
                since a kid and have always had a love for them. My favorite brand of
                car would have to be Acura. You get the reliable honda motor with the 
                luxury of the Acura brand! I myself drive a 2010 Acura TSX, a model that
                was discontinued after 2013. I've always wanted to own a TSX and the fact
                it was discontinued makes me love it that much more. Not to many people have
                them and they'll only get harder to acquire!
