            <h3>Aside</h3>
            <p>From personal expirience with both vehicles, Totoya ( in my opinion ) has the most reliable cars. However with Toyota
                I feel as though their interiors on their older model cars are a bit mundane, as to where Honda had a more luxury feel.
                With toyota manufacturing cars longer than honda I would have assumed they would have had the upper hand on honda when it
                came to design. Something about Honda's vehicles feels sporty, luxury, and reliable hence why they are my favorite brand!
